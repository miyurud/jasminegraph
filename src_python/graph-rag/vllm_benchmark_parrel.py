prompt ="""You are an expert information extractor specialized in knowledge graph construction. 
Extract all subject-predicate-object triples from the following text. 

Output each triple as a **JSON object**, separated by `#`. Use this format:

{
  "source": {
    "id": "<unique_node_id>",
    "properties": {
      "id": "<unique_node_id>",
      "label": "<EntityType>",
      "name": "<EntityName>"
    }
  },
  "destination": {
    "id": "<unique_node_id>",
    "properties": {
      "id": "<unique_node_id>",
      "label": "<EntityType>",
      "name": "<EntityName>"
    }
  },
  "properties": {
    "id": "<unique_relationship_id>",
    "type": "<Predicate>",
    "description": "<Human-readable description of the triple>"
  }
}

Instructions:
- Output **only JSON objects** separated by `#`.
- Use **consistent and unique IDs** by concatenating label + name in lowercase with underscores.
- Populate all fields accurately, including labels and descriptions.
- Extract **as many meaningful triples as possible**.

Example:

Text: 'Barack Obama was born in Honolulu on August 4, 1961. He served as the 44th President of the United States.'
