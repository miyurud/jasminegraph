# JasmineGraph

## 1. Introduction
JasmineGraph is a C/C++ based distributed graph database server. It has been developed following the [Acacia](https://github.com/miyurud/Acacia) graph database server architecture. JasmineGraph can be run on single computer as well as on a compute cluster.

## 2. Building JasmineGraph on Single Computer
**Prerequisites**

The following build tools, applications, and libraries need to be installed before building JasmineGraph. The CMakeLists.txt file's entries need to be updated to match with the installation locations of the dependencies. For examole, if you install SpdLog in a directory called "software" in your Linux system you may have to add a line as "include_directories("$ENV{HOME}/software/spdlog/include")" to get the SpdLog's header files associated with you build process.

- GCC 9.1.0 (recommended) or above
- Cmake version 3.10.3 or above
- Google Flat Buffers (https://github.com/google/flatbuffers)
    - Clone the flatbuffers repository to $ENV{HOME}/software
    - Checkout Tag [v1.12.0](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/archive/v1.12.0.zip)
    - Follow https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_building.html link to build flatbuffers
- Metis (http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/download)
    - Follow the installation guidelines provided in this [URL](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/download).
- SpdLog (https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
    - Clone or download the repository from the above link
    - Issue "cmake ."
    - Issue "make" followed by "sudo make install"
- SQLite3 (https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
- cppkafka (https://github.com/mfontanini/cppkafka)
    - Install librdkafka - Follow the Readme in (https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka)
    - Install boost library - use 'sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev'
    - Follow the guidelines in (https://github.com/mfontanini/cppkafka#compiling)
    - When doing the above step for `cmake <OPTIONS> ..` use of `cmake ..` should be sufficient enough
    - Once cppkafka is built install it by running 'sudo make install' from the build directory
- Xerces-c-3.2.2 (https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/)
    - Intallation guide is available at http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/build-3.html
    - When configuring Xerces skip the use of transcoder ICU by using the flag --disable-transcoder-icu
    - Once installed specify the target_link_libraries path to xerces.
- Jsoncpp(https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp)
    - Install the release https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/releases/tag/1.8.4
    - Issue "cmake ."
    - Issue "make" followed by "sudo make install"
- pigz (optional)
    - pigz, which stands for Parallel Implementation of GZip, is a fully functional
      replacement for gzip that exploits multiple processors and multiple cores to
      the hilt when compressing data.
    - JasmineGraph by default uses pigz for file compression and decompression.
    - However, if pigz is not found, gzip is used instead.
    - Download pigz from (http://zlib.net/pigz/) or (https://github.com/madler/pigz.git).
    - Type "make" in pigz directory to build the "pigz" executable. 
    - Add pigz executable's path to ~/.bashrc file and refresh.
- nlohmann_json (https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
    - Download the nolhmann latest release include.zip i:e [include.zip](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.9.1/include.zip) 
    - Create a directory in your software directory named `nlohmann_json`
    - Extract the `include.zip` to  `nlohmann_json` directory
    - Issue "cmake ."
    - Issue "make" followed by "sudo make install"
- xerces ([Download](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi))
    - Install the `xerces-c`
      - Download the archive from the xerces.apache.org website
      - Unzip the archive xerces-c-3.2.3.zip
      - Run `cmake .` & `sudo make install`
- python3.5 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/)
    - Read this [blog](https://passingcuriosity.com/2015/installing-python-from-source/) for more details on setting up python3.5
- Recent versions of TensorFlow, numpy, scipy, sklearn, and networkx are required (but networkx must be <=1.11). You can install all the required packages using the following command:

   pip install -r ./GraphSAGE/requirements

First, this repository should be cloned into one of your computer's local directory. Then change directory to jasminegraph and run ./build.sh to build the JasmineGraph executable.

## 3. Running JasmineGraph
JasmineGraph can be run by executing the run.sh script. This will start master on your local computer while workers are created in the list of the hosts mentioned in the conf/hosts.txt file.

## 4. Building and Running JasmineGraph on Docker
JasmineGraph can be run inside a docker image. After cloning the project, build the image as follows:

    cd docker
    docker build -t jasminegraph .


Run the image by providing the appropriate volume mount paths and parameters: 

    docker run -v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw" -v "/root/.ssh:/home/user/.ssh" -v "/tmp:/tmp" -v "/var/tmp/jasminegraph-localstore:/var/tmp/jasminegraph-localstore" -v "/var/tmp/jasminegraph-aggregate:/var/tmp/jasminegraph-aggregate" -v "/home/user/Documents/jasminegraph/metadb:/home/ubuntu/software/jasminegraph/metadb" -v "/home/user/Documents/MSc/jasminegraph/performancedb:/home/ubuntu/software/jasminegraph/performancedb" -p 7777:7777 -p 7778:7778 jasminegraph --MODE 1 --MASTERIP <docker0 interface ip> --WORKERS 4 --WORKERIP <docker0 interface ip> --ENABLE_NMON false
